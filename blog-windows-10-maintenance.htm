            <h1>BLOG - Windows 10 Mainenance</h1>
            <hr noshade>
            <p>Windows 10 is the newest (and as of the end of Windows 7, the only supported) operating system by Microsoft. Chances are, unless you're running MacOS, you're using it - unless, of course, your computer has decided it's had enough of running, and instead, has taken to a leisurely walk in the park, crawling slowly through tasks it once had no issue with. Luckily, there's likely quite a lot you can do about that. Here, we'll go through some simple yet effective ways you can keep Windows 10 at peak performance.</p>
            <h2>Updates</h2>
            <p>One of the best ways to get the most out of Windows 10 is to ensure you're up to date with the latest fixes and security updates. Checking for and downloading updates is very easy and chances are Windows 10 does these automatically for you. Nevertheless, to check for the latest updates and download them, simply type in your search bar "Check for updates".</p>
            <p>This will bring up the window for managing Windows 10 updates as pictured below.</p>
            <img src="assets/blogs/win10-maintenance/check-for-updates.webp" width="600" height="auto">
            <p>Clicking "Check for updates" will start the process of searching for and installing the latest updates for Windows.</p>
            <h2>Disk Clean-Up</h2>
            <p>Disk Clean-up is a tool in Windows used to remove junk files from your computer to free up space. To run the Disk Clean-up, simply type into your search bar "Disk Clean-up" and it will open up a window asking which disk you would like to clean. In this example, I selected the drive Windows was installed on.</p>

            <p><sub> Note: If you have more than one drive, you can use the drop down menu to select them.</sub></p>
            <p>Once the disk has been selected, click OK. This will bring up a new window where you can select which items you'd like to remove.</p>
            <img src="assets/blogs/win10-maintenance/drive-clean.webp">
            <p>As you can see, I was able to free up over 3.6 GB of junk from my computer. Once you've selected which items you'd like to remove, click OK and it will begin the removal process.  You can also use the "Clean up system files" to remove useless data Windows has left behind from past updates, etc. in the same manner.</p>
            <h2>Power Options</h2>
            <p>This is especially useful if you're using a laptop, although desktop users can see a benefit from this. Windows power options will allow you to select higher performance, longer battery life, or balanced profiles. To open power options, type in your search bar "Power and sleep settings"- and on the window that appears, click "Additional power settings" under "Related settings".</p>
            <img src="assets/blogs/win10-maintenance/power-options.webp">
            <p>From there, you'll be greeted with the Power Options window. To favour performance, simply click "High performance" (this may be hidden under "Show additional plans").</p>
            <img src="assets/blogs/win10-maintenance/power-plans.webp">
            <p><sub>Note: If you're using a laptop, selecting "High performance" will have a negative effect on the battery discharge rate.</sub></p>
            <h2>Virus Scans</h2>
            <p>It's incredibly important to protect yourself while connected to the internet, and if you don't have an anti-virus installed already, you get one now. Malware and viruses can slow down your computer while stealing personal information.
