            <hr noshade>
            <p>Malware is something you'll almost certainly come across when browsing the internet- and you may not even realize you're infected. But that doesn't mean you can't take measures to protect yourself for when the time comes. </p>
            <h3>First off, what even is malware?</h3>
            <p><b>Mal</b>icious Soft<b>ware</b> is any piece of software written with the intent to cause harm or damage to your computer, laptop, phone, Nintendo Wii, Space shuttle etc. It can cause your system to lose performance, your private data to be leaked, install rogue programs, or give you pop-ups for less than desirable products. Sounds bad, right? Well- yes. It's not something you want, but luckily most of the time it's something that can easily be removed.</p>
            <p>There are anti-malware programs out there and more often than not, your anti-virus software (You do have an anti-virus, don't you?) will have some level of malware removal built into it.</p>
            <h2><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/" target="_blank">RKill</a></h2>
            <p>RKill is a tool created by bleepingcomputer.com which is designed to terminate known malware processes so that regular malware removal programs can then run and clean up your computer.</p>
            <p>RKill isn't designed to remove malware itself, but by terminating malware processes your anti-virus will have an easier time removing malicious software. </p>
            <h3>Step One</h3>
            <p>As soon as you run the rkill.exe file, RKill will get straight to work without having to install anything. This is the screen you'll be greeted with as RKill starts scanning for threats.</p>
            <img src="assets/blogs/malware-removal/rkill-step-1.webp">
            <h3>Step Two</h3>
            <p>Once the scan has finished, RKill will inform you of any problems- and let you know it's time to use your anti-virus software to scan your computer for malware. That's all there is to it!</p>
            <img src="assets/blogs/malware-removal/rkill-step-two.webp">
            <h2><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank">Malwarebytes</a></h2>
            <p>Released in 2006, Malwarebytes has proven to be an excellent line of defense against most malware, with its most recent stable version released June 27, 2019. Malwarebytes is currently available for Windows, iOS, and Android platforms.</p>
            <h3>Step One</h3>
            <p>To start the scan, click Scan Now. Malwarebytes will scan your PC for viruses.</p>
            <img src="assets/blogs/malware-removal/malwarebytes-step-one.webp">
            <p>The scan is now complete. If you have any malware on your computer that Malwarebytes was able to detect, it'll be displayed here and give you the option to quarantine, remove, or restore the suspected items (In case of a false positive).</p>
            <img src="assets/blogs/malware-removal/malwarebytes-step-two.webp">
            <p>So in summary - download and run RKill, and then Malwarebytes. At MyTech, we've found that these two programs being used in conjunction with each other are more than capable of removing any known malicious software you might have on your computer.</p>
            <p>That's it! You're done! It's worth noting prevention is probably better than the cure. Only download things from websites you trust, and browse the web in a safe manner. </p>
